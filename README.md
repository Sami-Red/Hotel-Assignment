# Hotel-Assignment

This project was created as part of the Programming Principles II module where we had to create a hotel booking system, where the user can do the following:
- Add customers to the system.
- View all rooms.
- Show Empty rooms.
- Delete the customer.
- Load/ Save the programs from a file.
- Sort the rooms alphabetically by the customers' names.
- Exit the program.
- Etc.
